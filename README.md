### CryptCom is end to end encryption chatting application.

You can create a chatroom and invite others by sharing room name and password. People who got your password can readonly what you are saying. Users who don't have password can also enter the chatroom but won't be able to read your crypted message.

### This app uses AES encryption to encrypt your messages which are impossible to decrypt without the password.
